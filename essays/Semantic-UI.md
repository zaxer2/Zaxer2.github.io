## Frameworks are hard

Learning a framework, API, or new programming language is always a burden of similar nature. That is, it's just a matter of looking up the syntax neccessary to get done what you need to get done until you get used to it and eventually master it over time. There are cases where this can be satisfying or neccessary, and cases where it may be a waste of time or a slog to drag through. They have different skill curves, and different appropriate applications. I'm going to be going over, how I see it, what those are.

### Programming languages

Learning a new programming language is, generally, quite easy. The "roots" of a programming language are usually the same, and the only difficulty is with learning how these familiar pieces are meant to be syntaxed. All programming languages will usually have a way to store variables, arrays, assignments and loops. More complicated ones will have data ADTs: stuff like stacks, queues, lists, already implemented. Generally, getting the grassroots of a new language is not frustrating and establishes a good framework for more complicated tasks in that language.

### Programming APIs

More difficult than learning the basics of a language is learning an API (in this case I'll be referencing my experience with the Unity scripting API). Whereas the basics of a programming language usually have a few core functions that are easy to intuit, APIs branch out somewhat, tying things together in ways that might not be so expected. The unity API, for example, has specific data types tied to their game objects, and specific functions you're supposed to call to get the attributes of these game objects. The difficulty here comes from learning how information is tied together, and what you're supposed to do to establish connections between the code on the backend and the user interface on the front.

### Frameworks

Frameworks, in this example referencing the SemanticUI framework, are the most difficult to pick up of the options listed here. Rather than providing the main means of communication between the backend and the UI, they provide instead a series of shortcuts from points A to B. And while these are usually helpful shortcuts, they are often complicated or unintuitive by design. A large part of the appeal of a framework is to make programming easier, so as a result they need to be functionally useful as well as straightforward, which often comes at the cost of simplicity. The difficulty of integrating a framework comes from learning the shortcuts the developers built, how those shortcuts tie into the UI, and how you can tie those shortcuts together into your backend. As a developer, shortcuts are an important part of streamlining your development proccess, but trying to use someone else's shortcuts can be extremely difficult, especially if those shortcuts were designed with different goals in mind than your own.

## Learning one of these should not be taken lightly

Learning any of the above is really, really challenging. And learning too many languages, APIs, and Frameworks can lead to internal confusion. You start mixing up syntaxes, it's a mess. So, I maintain that learning a new language or API should not be taken lightly. A class should offer the introduction and mastery of an API, not a haphazard jumble accross multiple languages and APIs to be picked up, ingrained, and then never used again. That's the flaw, as I see it, of this 314 course as it's currently going. And while I'm sure Javascript and Underscore are going to make their return, I don't enjoy the scope of technologies being practiced here, and would much prefer if we instead focused on mastery of a smaller set of tools.
