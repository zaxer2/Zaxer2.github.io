summary: I developed a calculator which can accept a series of operators and operands and parse it to produce the result using a postfix method

Postfix Calculator was developed as a project requirement for ICS 211, and employs the methods of a binary search tree to construct and solve the operations required to produce the correct result.

For this project, I developed the whole thing given only the restritctions and requirements.

Here is an example of a mathematical string that can be solved by my calculator:

```
6 6 / 2 * 3 + 5 - 2 **
```
