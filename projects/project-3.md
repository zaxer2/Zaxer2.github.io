summary: A simplistic shooter game I developed on Scratch in my free time
---

Space chase is  a very simple shooter game I doodled up in the rudimentary programming-for-kids program "Scratch". I developed it when I was 13. The gameplay is very simplistic, and involves moving a spaceship around a tunnel. It is based heavily off of the classic arcade game "Tempest", with a few notable downgrades.

This is one of the projects that inspired my passion for game design.
